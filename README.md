# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
	In order to help Louise figure out if her play can meet its fundraising goals, massive fundraising data was collected from all around the world from a variety of events. 
The data was then analyzed by the outcomes based on launch date and outcomes based on goals. 

### Purpose
	The purpose of this challenge was to figure out if Louise's play would meet it's fundraising goals in a short amount of time. By analyzing outcomes based on goals, Louise would be 
able to figure out whether her fundraising goals set for the play were realistic. Additionally, the data was also analyzed by looking at the outcomes based on launch date 
in order to understand whether theater fundraising events are likelier to be successful during certain times of the year.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](path/to/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)

This line graph displays the theatre outcomes across the years based on the month the event was launched. 
The number of successful theatre outcomes increases during spring months, peaks in the month of May and has the lowest number of successful outcomes in the month of December.
The number of failed theatre outcomes is the greatest in October. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

This line graph displays the outcomes based on goal outcomes. The percentage of successful outcomes was the greatest when the fundraising goal was less than $1000. 
58% of fundraising goals that are equal to or greater than $50000 failed. There was also a positive correlation of the number of canceled events as the fundraising goals increased. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
For Louise's play fundraising event to be successful, the best time to launch it would be May to increase the likelihood of her event being successful.
Louise should avoid launching her play in December, since the likelihood of fundraising event failing or succeeding is nearly 50/50. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Louise should avoid setting very high fundraising goals as that increasese the likelihood of failure or her event being cancelled.  
Ideally, a fundraising goal of less than 1000 has the highest probability of success. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
This dataset has not been analyzed for the duration of the fundraising events. For instance, analyzing outcomes based on duration and fundraising goals would help Louise decide
how long to hold her fundraising event for. For instance, if higher fundraising goals are successful with a longer duration, then that should be taken into consideration. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Instead of analyzing all the data from all the years, it would be useful to see subcategory play (not parent category theater) outcomes based on launch date for the past 5 years.
This would make the data more relevant, because there is a chance that plays aren't as popular as they were decades ago.

Additionally, having a graph of outcomes based on duration of the fundraising events for different fundraising goals would provide insight into whether higher fundraising goals can be acheived with longer duration.
This is important because it was stated that Louise has a short amount of time for her event.
